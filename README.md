- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**: If you encounter module import errors, ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

**Streamlit Not Found**: If Streamlit commands are not recognized, ensure your Python environment includes the installation directory in PATH.

**Slow Performance**: For better performance with complex quantum simulations:
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Use a modern browser with hardware acceleration enabled
- Reduce the number of simulation shots for faster results

### Performance Tips
- Use Chrome or Firefox for best performance
- Enable hardware acceleration in browser settings
- Keep the number of qubits reasonable (≤5 for real-time interaction)
- Use the measurement simulator for statistical analysis rather than full state simulation when possible
