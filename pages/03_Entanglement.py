st.markdown("""
Entanglement links qubits so their states are *correlated no matter the distance*.

- Measuring one instantly tells you about the other.
- Famous Example: The Bell state  
  $$
  |\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)
  $$

Einstein called it “spooky action at a distance.”
